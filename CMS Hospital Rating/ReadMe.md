#Problem Statement
CMS rates hospitals in the US on a scale of 1-5 with the objective to make it easier for patients and consumers to compare the quality of hospitals.The ratings directly influence the choice of the hospital made by consumers and may have a significant impact on the revenue earned by hospitals. Thus, it is extremely important for hospitals to understand the methodology used by CMS for calculating the ratings so that they can work on improving the factors that influence them.
This project is focused on developing an approach to calculate hospital ratings and using it to identify areas of improvement for certain hospitals. It will also require a thorough understanding of the rating system developed by CMS.

##Part 1 - Supervised Learning-Based Rating

Think about the types of supervised models you will choose for predicting the star ratings (1-5, five-class classification). Consider all the practical as well as technical aspects involved. 

##Part 2 - Clustering-Based Rating (Unsupervised)
The methodology followed by CMS to assign ratings is described in the report here. It is an unsupervised method. Create an unsupervised clustering model to assign hospital ratings (1-5) using the 64 measures specified by the CMS. The main problem is to calculate the 7 group scores for each hospital. Various methods exist to conduct this analysis, two of which are mentioned below. The second method is similar to the one used by CMS.
